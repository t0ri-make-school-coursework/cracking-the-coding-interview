# Robot in a Grid
# Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of a grid with r rows and c columns.
# The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off
# limits" such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for
# the robot from the left to the bottom right.
